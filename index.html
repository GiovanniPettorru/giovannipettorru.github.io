                <h2>Short biography</h2>
                <p>
                    <br> Giovanni Pettorru </br> received a B.Sc. degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the University of Cagliari in 2020, with a thesis on the <i>Implementation of a Parking Occupancy Detection System Based on Magnetometer Sensor</i>. In 2022, he earned a Masterâ€™s Degree in Internet Engineering from the same university, presenting a thesis titled <i>Secure and Low-Latency Communications Based on WebSocket and QUIC in the Internet of Things Scenario</i>. Currently, he is pursuing a PhD at the University of Cagliari, within the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (DIEE/UdR CNIT). His research interests focus on network security and GPS-free localization in IoT environments. <br><br>
                    Giovanni is an active member of IEEE as a graduate student. He has demonstrated his communication skills by placing third in the 1st Three-Minute Thesis (3MT) competition at IEEE ICC 2023 and participating as one of the 15 finalists in the Four-Minute Thesis (4MT) at IEEE Globecom 2024. These competitions challenge PhD students to convey their research effectively to a non-specialist audience in just three and four minutes. His strong performance in these contests highlights his ability to communicate complex ideas clearly and precisely. Giovanni has also contributed to the IEEE community by serving as a PC member at the AQ-IoT 2023 conference. <br><br>
                    Additionally, Giovanni's entrepreneurial spirit shone through with the business idea Agricultural Geolocation and Resource Optimization (AGROS). This innovative project achieved a top 10 finish in the Start Cup 2024 Sardegna competition and earned an award from the University of Cagliari as part of the e.INS Project - Ecosystem of Innovation for Next Generation Sardinia - SPOKE 07 - Low Carbon Technologies for the Energy Transition. AGROS was also recognized as one of the top 10 innovative ideas in the AgriFuture program, a competition promoted by the Sportello Startup of Sardegna Ricerche, which supports high-tech innovations in the agro-food sector both financially and through a business training program.
