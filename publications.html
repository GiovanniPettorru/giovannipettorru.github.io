                <p>Only the chairs can edit Human Activity Recognition (HAR) techniques are playing nowadays a key role in identifying and categorizing human activities 
                    based on environmental information. More recently, the use of Channel State Information (CSI) is gaining momentum because this information can be extracted
                    in a non-intrusive manner. CSI-based algorithms leverage the correlation between CSI dynamics of wireless transmissions and body motions. In this context,
                    this study investigates the challenge of preserving user privacy in CSI-based HAR for eHealth Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) applications. The impact of 
                    simple filter-based CSI obfuscation is evaluated on the accuracy performance of a Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based HAR model. Using a publicly available dataset,
                    the accuracy between original and obfuscated versions of the dataset generated by simple filtering techniques is compared. The results show significant performance
                    degradation when data is obfuscated, ranging from a minimum of 17.9% to a maximum of nearly 90% accuracy degradation, compared to 100% accuracy using the original dataset.

                <p>This paper addresses the problem of data privacy in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) applications for eHealth. Cryptography, a proven privacy safeguard 
                    on the Internet, remains underutilized in the HAR context, as observed in the existing literature. This study highlights the importance of cryptographic 
                    practices by conducting a performance analysis, focusing on the accuracy of HAR with and without data en-cryption. This paper proves that even by 
                    introducing a very simple cryptographic mechanism, a potential eavesdropper would experience a reduction of more than 20% of accuracy in the activity 
                    recognition task as compared to the case where no encryption is used, at the price of a limited increase in the energy consumption for the involved 
                    sensors. Such preliminary results demonstrate the effectiveness of encryption for applications of this type, encouraging further exploration and 
                    refinement in this direction.

                <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized the world, connecting billions of devices that offer assistance 
                    in various aspects of users’ daily lives. Context-aware IoT applications exploit real-time environmental, 
                    user-specific, or situational data to dynamically adapt to users’ needs, offering tailored experiences. 
                    In particular, Location-Based Services (LBS) exploit geographical information to adapt to environmental settings or 
                    provide recommendations based on users’ and nodes’ positions, thus delivering efficient and personalized services. 
                    To this end, there is growing interest in developing IoT localization systems within the scientific community. 
                    In addition, due to the sensitivity and privacy inherent to precise location information, LBS introduce new security 
                    challenges. To ensure a more secure and trustworthy system, researchers are studying how to prevent vulnerabilities
                    and mitigate risks from the early design stages of LBS-empowered IoT applications. The goal of this study is to carry
                    out an in-depth examination of localization techniques for IoT, with an emphasis on both the signal-processing 
                    design and security aspects. The investigation focuses primarily on active radio localization techniques, 
                    classifying them into range-based and range-free algorithms, while also exploring hybrid approaches.
                    Next, security considerations are explored in depth, examining the main attacks for each localization 
                    technique and linking them to the most interesting solutions proposed in the literature. By highlighting 
                    advances, analyzing challenges, and providing solutions, the survey aims to guide researchers in navigating the 
                    complex IoT localization landscape.

                <p> The last years have been characterized by strong market exploitation of the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies 
                    in different application domains, such as Industry 4.0, smart cities, and eHealth. All the relevant solutions should 
                    properly address the security issues to ensure that sensor data and actuators are not under the control of malicious
                    entities. Additionally, many applications should at the same time provide low-latency communications, as in the 
                    case for instance of remote control of industrial robots. Low latency and security are two of the most important 
                    challenges to be addressed for the successful deployment of IoT applications. These issues have been analyzed by 
                    several scientific papers and surveys that appeared in the last decade. However, few of them consider the two 
                    challenges jointly. Moreover, the security aspects are primarily investigated only in specific application domains 
                    or protocol levels and the latency issues are typically investigated only at low layers (e.g., physical, access). 
                    This paper addresses this shortcoming and provides a systematic review of state-of-the-art solutions for providing 
                    fast and secure IoT communications. Although the two requirements may appear to be in contrast to each other, 
                    we investigate possible integrated solutions that minimize device connection and service provisioning. 
                    We follow an approach where the proposals are reviewed by grouping them based on the reference architectural layer, 
                    i.e., access, network, and application layers. We also review the works that propose promising solutions that rely 
                    on the exploitation of the QUIC protocol at the higher levels of the protocol stack.

                <p> This work addresses the problem of security and low latency in communications typical of several Internet of Things 
                    (IoT) scenarios, such as those in Industry 4.0 applications. In particular, we propose a WebSocket over QUIC 
                    (WS-QUIC) protocol for intra-network communications between the IoT devices and the gateway. In particular, 
                    low latency is achieved by combining the connection persistence of WebSocket (WS) with the reduced connection 
                    establishment time required by QUIC. Moreover, the use of QUIC implicitly exploit the security extensions of 
                    WS provided by the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. We experimentally analyzed the performance of the 
                    proposed system and compare it with that provided by other Web-based secure protocols, such as HyperText Transfer 
                    Protocol Secure (HTTPS) and WebSocket Secure (WSS). Our results show that WS-QUIC outperforms HTTPS and WSS for 
                    medium-large file sizes. Moreover, the use of the so-called TLS ticket resumption makes WS-QUIC suitable also for 
                    medium-small file sizes. Finally, we also discuss the potential use of a single shared session ticket between 
                    different IoT devices in the same cluster to further decrease the latency.

                <p> Given the growing importance of Location-Based Services (LBS) in the broader Internet of Things (IoT) context, 
                    efficient and optimized location algorithms are essential. To address this, a hybrid WiFi/Bluetooth (BLT) 
                    localization algorithm is experimentally investigated in this paper. This approach uses Received Signal Strength 
                    (RSS) information to estimate target-anchors' distances, which are then fed at the input of a Least Squares 
                    (LS)-based localization algorithm to finally estimate the target position. The study relies on a dataset created 
                    by the authors with the goal of developing and evaluating RSS-based localization algorithms that incorporate the 
                    fusion of data from different technologies. The experimental results presented in this paper confirm that such an 
                    approach improves the accuracy, resilience, and robustness of location estimation and optimizes IoT services based 
                    on contextual information with respect to schemes based on a single technology.

                <p> Natural ecosystem conservation is a topical issue that is receiving increasing attention from different branches of 
                    the scientific community. Forests and woodlands are major contributors to climate change mitigation, able to absorb

                    processing using machine learning techniques. Our solution involves the construction of a neural network-based 
                    multiclass classifier that can classify the incoming Wi-Fi signal from many sources based on the received signal 
                    strength. The solution was carried out by training the neural network to predict different output classes 
                    corresponding to different vehicular (0-30Km/h,30-60Km/h, 60-90Km/h, 90-120Km/h) and several pedestrian speed 
                    ranges among 0-15Km/h.

                <p> This paper addresses the issue of monitoring and tracking people and vehicles within smart cities. 
                    The actors in this work jointly cooperate in sensing, sensible data processing, anonymized data delivery, and 
                    data processing, with the final goal of providing real-time mapping of vehicular and pedestrian concentration 
                    conditions. The classification of conditions can bring out critical situations that can be communicated in real-time 
                    to citizens. Tests were conducted in the city of Cagliari, Italy.

                <p> The time lost looking for a free parking spot in a city impacts negatively not only on the mood of the drivers 
                    but also on the environment in terms of air quality and fuel consumption. The vehicle detection can be considered 
                    as the most important task in Smart Parking systems as it allows to automatically monitor the occupancy state of 
                    the parking spots in a city. In this paper, we implement and test a vehicle detection system based on a magnetometer 
                    sensor, which is part of a complete Smart Parking system under development at the University of Cagliari. 
                    After a preliminary analysis conducted to test the performance of the magnetometer, we conducted two specific 
                    experiments to investigate the suitability of the magnetometer as the mean to detect the presence of a vehicle 
                    in the parking spots. The first experiment, involving 15 different vehicles, has demonstrated that the magnetometer 
                    can be used to reliably detect the presence of a vehicle in a parking spot if it is placed under the front or 
                    rear axle of the vehicle. From the second experiment it resulted that, when considering 3 adjacent parking spots 
                    and only one magnetometer placed in the central spot, it is not possible to reliably detect the vehicles parked on 
                    the adjacent spots. Therefore, one magnetometer for each considered parking spot is needed.
