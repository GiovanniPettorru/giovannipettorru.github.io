                <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized the world, connecting billions of devices that offer assistance 
                    in various aspects of users’ daily lives. Context-aware IoT applications exploit real-time environmental, 
                    user-specific, or situational data to dynamically adapt to users’ needs, offering tailored experiences. 
                    In particular, Location-Based Services (LBS) exploit geographical information to adapt to environmental settings or 
                    provide recommendations based on users’ and nodes’ positions, thus delivering efficient and personalized services. 
                    To this end, there is growing interest in developing IoT localization systems within the scientific community. 
                    In addition, due to the sensitivity and privacy inherent to precise location information, LBS introduce new security 
                    challenges. To ensure a more secure and trustworthy system, researchers are studying how to prevent vulnerabilities
                    and mitigate risks from the early design stages of LBS-empowered IoT applications. The goal of this study is to carry
                    out an in-depth examination of localization techniques for IoT, with an emphasis on both the signal-processing 
                    design and security aspects. The investigation focuses primarily on active radio localization techniques, 
                    classifying them into range-based and range-free algorithms, while also exploring hybrid approaches.
                    Next, security considerations are explored in depth, examining the main attacks for each localization 
                    technique and linking them to the most interesting solutions proposed in the literature. By highlighting 
                    advances, analyzing challenges, and providing solutions, the survey aims to guide researchers in navigating the 
                    complex IoT localization landscape.
