                <p> Secure and low-latency data exchange is gaining more and more attention in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. 
                    To achieve such stringent requirements, we propose to combine persistent connections and TLS session ticket resumption,
                    as in WebSocket (WS) and QUIC, respectively. Considering the nodes of an IoT cluster as a single virtual entity, we 
                    propose to integrate an innovative network management strategy, which employs a publish-subscribe (Pub/Sub) architecture 
                    based on the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol, for TLS session tickets sharing between cluster nodes 
                    to mitigate the session initialization latency. The proposed system is referred to as WS over QUIC and MQTT (WSQM) 
                    and its performance is experimentally assessed with IoT-compliant devices. Our results show that WSQM reduces the latency
                    if compared with similar alternatives that rely on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Transport Layer Security (TLS),
                    as well as other QUIC-based protocols such as the HyperText Transfer Protocol version 3 (HTTP/3). Moreover, WSQM achieves
                    minimal resource utilization in terms of percentage of RAM and CPU usage, thus highlighting its ability to meet the 
                    critical requirements of IoT applications.

                <p> The growing integration of IoT devices into Edge and Fog infrastructures, alongside the increasing adoption of 
                    low-latency QUIC-based protocols like HTTP/3, has intensified the need for lightweight, resource-efficient 
                    security mechanisms to counter emerging threats such as request smuggling. Within this context, proxy-based 
                    architectures offer an optimal trade-off to strengthen network security while accommodating the limited 
                    computational capacity of IoT devices. In this direction, this paper presents a comprehensive experimental 
                    evaluation of the impact of different proxies for HTTP/3 services on resource usage when deployed on platforms 
                    such as the Raspberry Pi (RPi), considering diverse traffic patterns, operational conditions, and device 
                    configurations. The results highlight that proxies can achieve a promising balance between security and resource 
                    overhead, confirming their viability for integration into distributed IoT-based Edge and Fog networks.

                <p>The upcoming deployment of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks promises to significantly outperform 5G in terms of data rates, spectral efficiency, device densities, and, 
                    most importantly, latency and security. To cope with the increasingly complex network traffic, Network Traffic Classification (NTC) will be essential to ensure the high 
                    performance and security of a network, which is necessary for advanced applications. This is particularly relevant in the Internet of Things (IoT), where resource-constrained
                     platforms at the edge must manage tasks like traffic analysis and threat detection. In this context, balancing classification accuracy with computational efficiency is key 
                     to enabling practical, real-world deployments. Traditional payload-based and packet inspection methods are based on the identification of relevant patterns and fields in 
                     the packet content. However, such methods are nowadays limited by the rise of encrypted communications. To this end, the research community has turned its attention to 
                     statistical analysis and Machine Learning (ML). In particular, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are gaining momentum in the research community for ML-based NTC 
                     leveraging statistical analysis of flow characteristics. Therefore, this paper addresses CNN-based NTC in the presence of encrypted communications generated by the 
                     rising Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC) protocol. Different models are presented, and their performance is assessed to show the trade-off between classification 
                     accuracy and CNN complexity. In particular, our results show that even simple and low-complexity CNN architectures can achieve almost 92% accuracy with a very 
                     low-complexity architecture when compared to baseline architectures documented in the existing literature.

                    Location-Based Services (LBS) are crucial for enhancing user experience and operational efficiency across various applications. Although modern wireless technologies 
                    have significantly improved the accuracy of location estimates, there is still a gap in the literature on effectively measuring and evaluating the reliability of these estimates. 
                    Since the accuracy of LBS is strictly related to the quality of the provided service, the availability of a reliability index is paramount in determining how system resources are effectively allocated. 
                    To address this challenge, this paper introduces a reliability index specifically designed for Received Signal Strength (RSS)-based localization methods. 
                    Such an index assesses the trustworthiness of position estimates using universally available channel-specific parameters, namely the received power standard deviation and the estimated number of malicious anchors. 
                    The approach is validated through simulations employing detailed signal propagation models, demonstrating its robustness across various transmission conditions, system interferences, and levels of malicious activity.

                    Accurate and reliable localization is crucial in dynamic Internet of Things (IoT) environments where real-time, location-based decision-making is required. 
                    However, this presents significant challenges, especially when anchor availability or environmental conditions change. In this paper, we present a novel hybrid Received Signal Strength 
                    (RSS)-based localization approach that integrates fingerprinting algorithms with multilateration assistance to effectively address the challenges of scenario dynamism. 
                    The primary objective of this work is to improve robustness and reliability over standard fingerprinting-based algorithms. The results show that the proposed solution significantly 
                    outperforms traditional techniques as anchor availability decreases, achieving comparable performance in unobstructed scenarios. This demonstrates the robustness and adaptability of 
                    hybrid approaches combining fingerprinting and multilateration, thereby advancing research on this promising yet underexplored combination.

                    This paper examines the challenges posed by additive destructive interference and Denial of Service (DoS) jamming attacks 
                    on multilateration-based localization algorithms, particularly concerning Least Square (LS)-based approaches. Despite the increasing interest in localization
                     technologies in a wide range of applications, the vulnerabilities of these systems to such attacks have been insufficiently explored in existing literature. 
                     To evaluate the impact of jamming, scenarios with varying numbers of malicious nodes are considered in this paper to assess their effects on localization accuracy. 
                     The results reveal a significant degradation in accuracy as the number of compromised anchors increases. However, the implementation of mitigation strategies leads to 
                     a substantial performance improvement, effectively reducing the impact of interference and maintaining lower position estimation errors.

                    This paper analyzes the impact of specular signal reflections on the accuracy of Received Signal Strength (RSS)-based localization for Internet of Things 
                    (IoT) devices using the weighted least squares (WLS) regression algorithm within a two-ray propagation channel. Simulations with realistic WiFi/BLE settings,
                     considering distance, antenna heights, and carrier frequency, reveal that localization accuracy is significantly influenced by deep fades caused by surface reflections,
                      which depend on the geometry of anchor-target positions. A pseudo-outlier elimination approach based on feasible localization distances effectively mitigates this issue,
                       significantly reducing localization error. These findings offer practical insights into the performance of WLS-based IoT localization in two-ray environments and lay the
                        groundwork for GPS-free or GPS-denied localization systems in challenging scenarios, such as overwater environments, where two-ray propagation is predominant.

                    based on environmental information. More recently, the use of Channel State Information (CSI) is gaining momentum because this information can be extracted
                    in a non-intrusive manner. CSI-based algorithms leverage the correlation between CSI dynamics of wireless transmissions and body motions. In this context,
                    this study investigates the challenge of preserving user privacy in CSI-based HAR for eHealth Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) applications. The impact of 
                    simple filter-based CSI obfuscation is evaluated on the accuracy performance of a Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based HAR model. Using a publicly available dataset,
                    the accuracy between original and obfuscated versions of the dataset generated by simple filtering techniques is compared. The results show significant performance
                    degradation when data is obfuscated, ranging from a minimum of 17.9% to a maximum of nearly 90% accuracy degradation, compared to 100% accuracy using the original dataset.

                <p>This paper addresses the problem of data privacy in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) applications for eHealth. Cryptography, a proven privacy safeguard 
                    on the Internet, remains underutilized in the HAR context, as observed in the existing literature. This study highlights the importance of cryptographic 
                    practices by conducting a performance analysis, focusing on the accuracy of HAR with and without data en-cryption. This paper proves that even by 
                    introducing a very simple cryptographic mechanism, a potential eavesdropper would experience a reduction of more than 20% of accuracy in the activity 
                    recognition task as compared to the case where no encryption is used, at the price of a limited increase in the energy consumption for the involved

                    in various aspects of users’ daily lives. Context-aware IoT applications exploit real-time environmental, 
                    user-specific, or situational data to dynamically adapt to users’ needs, offering tailored experiences. 
                    In particular, Location-Based Services (LBS) exploit geographical information to adapt to environmental settings or 
                    provide recommendations based on users’ and nodes’ positions, thus delivering efficient and personalized services. 
                    To this end, there is growing interest in developing IoT localization systems within the scientific community. 
                    In addition, due to the sensitivity and privacy inherent to precise location information, LBS introduce new security

                    classifying them into range-based and range-free algorithms, while also exploring hybrid approaches.
                    Next, security considerations are explored in depth, examining the main attacks for each localization 
                    technique and linking them to the most interesting solutions proposed in the literature. By highlighting 
                    advances, analyzing challenges, and providing solutions, the survey aims to guide researchers in navigating the

                    in different application domains, such as Industry 4.0, smart cities, and eHealth. All the relevant solutions should

                    several scientific papers and surveys that appeared in the last decade. However, few of them consider the two 
                    challenges jointly. Moreover, the security aspects are primarily investigated only in specific application domains 
                    or protocol levels and the latency issues are typically investigated only at low layers (e.g., physical, access). 
                    This paper addresses this shortcoming and provides a systematic review of state-of-the-art solutions for providing 
                    fast and secure IoT communications. Although the two requirements may appear to be in contrast to each other, 
                    we investigate possible integrated solutions that minimize device connection and service provisioning. 
                    We follow an approach where the proposals are reviewed by grouping them based on the reference architectural layer, 
                    i.e., access, network, and application layers. We also review the works that propose promising solutions that rely 
                    on the exploitation of the QUIC protocol at the higher levels of the protocol stack.

                <p> This work addresses the problem of security and low latency in communications typical of several Internet of Things 
                    (IoT) scenarios, such as those in Industry 4.0 applications. In particular, we propose a WebSocket over QUIC 
                    (WS-QUIC) protocol for intra-network communications between the IoT devices and the gateway. In particular, 
                    low latency is achieved by combining the connection persistence of WebSocket (WS) with the reduced connection 
                    establishment time required by QUIC. Moreover, the use of QUIC implicitly exploit the security extensions of 
                    WS provided by the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. We experimentally analyzed the performance of the 
                    proposed system and compare it with that provided by other Web-based secure protocols, such as HyperText Transfer 
                    Protocol Secure (HTTPS) and WebSocket Secure (WSS). Our results show that WS-QUIC outperforms HTTPS and WSS for 
                    medium-large file sizes. Moreover, the use of the so-called TLS ticket resumption makes WS-QUIC suitable also for 
                    medium-small file sizes. Finally, we also discuss the potential use of a single shared session ticket between 
                    different IoT devices in the same cluster to further decrease the latency.

                <p> Given the growing importance of Location-Based Services (LBS) in the broader Internet of Things (IoT) context, 
                    efficient and optimized location algorithms are essential. To address this, a hybrid WiFi/Bluetooth (BLT) 
                    localization algorithm is experimentally investigated in this paper. This approach uses Received Signal Strength 
                    (RSS) information to estimate target-anchors' distances, which are then fed at the input of a Least Squares 
                    (LS)-based localization algorithm to finally estimate the target position. The study relies on a dataset created 
                    by the authors with the goal of developing and evaluating RSS-based localization algorithms that incorporate the 
                    fusion of data from different technologies. The experimental results presented in this paper confirm that such an 
                    approach improves the accuracy, resilience, and robustness of location estimation and optimizes IoT services based 
                    on contextual information with respect to schemes based on a single technology.

                <p> Natural ecosystem conservation is a topical issue that is receiving increasing attention from different branches of 
                    the scientific community. Forests and woodlands are major contributors to climate change mitigation, able to absorb 
                    significant amounts of carbon dioxide. The conservation of tree areas has been addressed through the adoption of 
                    different solutions. This paper proposes a new monitoring system and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for 
                    real-time fire detection. The system is based on intelligent Digital Mobile Radio (DMR) nodes and a Social Internet

                <p> Monitoring and control of natural environments is becoming increasingly sensitive in the face of climate change. 
                    This work proposes a solution for the protection to safeguard forests and woodlands against natural or arson fires. 
                    Currently, existing solutions have critical issues in terms of early detection of outbreaks, or rely on expensive 
                    solutions if implemented on a large scale. Electronic noses for fire smoke detection have been developed. 
                    The data is transmitted in real time to a Social Internet of Things (SIoT) cloud platform that analyzes the data and 
                    detects potential critical situations. Preliminary results obtained show the effectiveness of the system in detecting

                <p> The time lost looking for a free parking spot in a city impacts negatively not only on the mood of the drivers 
                    but also on the environment in terms of air quality and fuel consumption. The vehicle detection can be considered 
                    as the most important task in Smart Parking systems as it allows to automatically monitor the occupancy state of 
                    the parking spots in a city. In this paper, we implement and test a vehicle detection system based on a magnetometer 
                    sensor, which is part of a complete Smart Parking system under development at the University of Cagliari. 
                    After a preliminary analysis conducted to test the performance of the magnetometer, we conducted two specific 
                    experiments to investigate the suitability of the magnetometer as the mean to detect the presence of a vehicle 
                    in the parking spots. The first experiment, involving 15 different vehicles, has demonstrated that the magnetometer 
                    can be used to reliably detect the presence of a vehicle in a parking spot if it is placed under the front or 
                    rear axle of the vehicle. From the second experiment it resulted that, when considering 3 adjacent parking spots 
                    and only one magnetometer placed in the central spot, it is not possible to reliably detect the vehicles parked on 
                    the adjacent spots. Therefore, one magnetometer for each considered parking spot is needed.
