                <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized the world, connecting billions of devices that offer assistance 
                    in various aspects of users’ daily lives. Context-aware IoT applications exploit real-time environmental, 
                    user-specific, or situational data to dynamically adapt to users’ needs, offering tailored experiences. 
                    In particular, Location-Based Services (LBS) exploit geographical information to adapt to environmental settings or 
                    provide recommendations based on users’ and nodes’ positions, thus delivering efficient and personalized services. 
                    To this end, there is growing interest in developing IoT localization systems within the scientific community. 
                    In addition, due to the sensitivity and privacy inherent to precise location information, LBS introduce new security 
                    challenges. To ensure a more secure and trustworthy system, researchers are studying how to prevent vulnerabilities
                    and mitigate risks from the early design stages of LBS-empowered IoT applications. The goal of this study is to carry
                    out an in-depth examination of localization techniques for IoT, with an emphasis on both the signal-processing 
                    design and security aspects. The investigation focuses primarily on active radio localization techniques, 
                    classifying them into range-based and range-free algorithms, while also exploring hybrid approaches.
                    Next, security considerations are explored in depth, examining the main attacks for each localization 
                    technique and linking them to the most interesting solutions proposed in the literature. By highlighting 
                    advances, analyzing challenges, and providing solutions, the survey aims to guide researchers in navigating the 
                    complex IoT localization landscape.

            <h2> A Cross-Layer Survey on Secure and Low-Latency Communications in Next-Generation IoT </h2>
            <p> Martalo, M., Pettorru, G., Atzori, L. </p>
            <p> IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management, 2024 </p>

            <div class="abstract" id="abstract2" style="display: none;">
                <p> The last years have been characterized by strong market exploitation of the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies 
                    in different application domains, such as Industry 4.0, smart cities, and eHealth. All the relevant solutions should 
                    properly address the security issues to ensure that sensor data and actuators are not under the control of malicious
                    entities. Additionally, many applications should at the same time provide low-latency communications, as in the 
                    case for instance of remote control of industrial robots. Low latency and security are two of the most important 
                    challenges to be addressed for the successful deployment of IoT applications. These issues have been analyzed by 
                    several scientific papers and surveys that appeared in the last decade. However, few of them consider the two 
                    challenges jointly. Moreover, the security aspects are primarily investigated only in specific application domains 
                    or protocol levels and the latency issues are typically investigated only at low layers (e.g., physical, access). 
                    This paper addresses this shortcoming and provides a systematic review of state-of-the-art solutions for providing 
                    fast and secure IoT communications. Although the two requirements may appear to be in contrast to each other, 
                    we investigate possible integrated solutions that minimize device connection and service provisioning. 
                    We follow an approach where the proposals are reviewed by grouping them based on the reference architectural layer, 
                    i.e., access, network, and application layers. We also review the works that propose promising solutions that rely 
                    on the exploitation of the QUIC protocol at the higher levels of the protocol stack.
